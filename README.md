## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This site has been built as the Milestone Project 2 for my Code Institute software development diploma.
The aim of the site is to display a digital version of a vintage style memory game, complete with appealling visuals and clear and simple instructions so that 
users can have fun and challenge themselves as well as go through a pleasant visual experience.

## Technologies <a name="technologies"></a>


For this project I have used the below technologies:

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) for the build of the site

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) for the styling

- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript) for the interactive elements of the site

- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)
    Since I am typing this text through Gitpod, I figured it would go first in the list. All code was created through Gitpod and the workspace for this project resides there.

- [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
    This has been used to host and deploy the project.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    Used for their grid system, navbars, etc. I have also on many occasions modified the initial system for styling purposes.

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)
    Used for the cup icon, which I have used on both pages.

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) 
    Used for the scripts

- [Code Beautify CSS beautifier](https://codebeautify.org)
    Used to make my CSS look nicer and tidier

- [Beautify Tools HTML beautifier](http://beautifytools.com/html-beautifier.php)
    Used to make my HTML tidier 

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org)
    Used to check my HTML code
    
- [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
    Used to check my CSS code


I have also used the Chrome Developer Tools extensively throughout the project. They have been very useful for each change that I made, and to double-check my ideas before implementing them. 
I have used the javascript console logging utility to check code before saving it and to troubleshoot.




## Media <a name="media"></a>

I have taken advantage of several useful resources for images and my logo. Please see below:

- [Logo Makr](https://logomakr.com/) 
    for the logo design

- [Vectorstock](https://www.vectorstock.com/) 
    I used this for the cute fruit images

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/6?next=%2Fstart) 
    for the icon used on this project

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) 
    for the image used in the UX section showing the different screen sizes.

- [Favicon](https://www.favicon.io)
    for the thumbnail icon on the internet tab header

- [Danika Draws](https://www.instagram.com/danika_draws)
    My friend Danika allowed me to use her illustration as the image on the back of the cards and also as 
    feature on the main page since I found that it was a perfect fit for my project
